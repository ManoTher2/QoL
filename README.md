# QoL
A TShock plugin that adds various Quality of Life features such as:
* Despawning Queen Bee if there is no players within 450 blocks.

* Overrides TShock's built-in ``/item`` command to show items in chat when the item is not found. <br>
  _Note: If you're using TShock in another language than English, all the texts related to ``/item`` command will be in English._
* New command ``/luck`` will show your luck in chat. (needed permisson is ``qol.luck``)

* New command ``/vote`` will vote for/against the current voting process. (needed permission is ``qol.vote``)
